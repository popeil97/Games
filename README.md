Games I've coded
First game is a Pong game, I made it multiplayer so two people can play using the up and down arrow keys and the w and s keys. Also to put an extra spin on the original I implemented a transporter to randomly transport the ball anywhere on the board. Had assistance to get a general feel for java applet, and sizing of paddle and ball with a tutorial.
